Putting all of her energy into her last steps of the running
race, Jamie crossed the finish line. To her disappointment, she
had failed to beat her personal best time, again. Jamie had
pushed herself for months to finally break her record, but it
was all for nothing. Recognizing how she felt about her
failure, Ken, her teammate, approached her and said, “Jamie,
even though you didn’t set a personal best time today, your
performances have improved dramatically. Your running skills
have progressed so much! You’ll definitely break your personal
best time in the next race!” After hearing his comments, she
felt confident about herself. Jamie, now motivated to keep
pushing for her goal, replied with a smile. “You’re right! Next
race, I’ll beat my best time for sure!”
