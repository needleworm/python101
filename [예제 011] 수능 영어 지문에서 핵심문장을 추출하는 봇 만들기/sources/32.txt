People have always wanted to be around other people and
to learn from them. Cities have long been dynamos of social
possibility, foundries of art, music, and fashion. Slang, or, if you
prefer, “lexical innovation,” has always started in cities ― an
outgrowth of all those different people so frequently exposed to
one another. It spreads outward, in a manner not unlike trans-
missible disease, which itself typically “takes off” in cities. If, as
the noted linguist Leonard Bloomfield argued, the way a person
talks is a “composite result of what he has heard before,” then
language innovation would happen where the most people heard
and talked to the most other people. Cities drive taste change,
because they are often the creative people cities seem
to attract. Media, ever more global, ever more far-reaching,
spread language faster to more people.
