There is something deeply paradoxical about the professional
status of sports journalism, especially in the medium of print.
In discharging their usual responsibilities of description and
commentary, reporters’ accounts of sports events are eagerly
consulted by sports fans, while in their broader journalistic
role of covering sport in its many forms, sports journalists are
among the most visible of all contemporary writers. The
ruminations of the elite class of ‘celebrity’ sports journalists
are much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative
contracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of
journalism. Yet sports journalists do not have a standing in
their profession that corresponds to the size of their readerships
or of their pay packets, with the old saying (now reaching the
status of cliché) that sport is the ‘toy department of the news
media’ still readily to hand as a dismissal of the worth of what
sports journalists do. This reluctance to take sports journalism
seriously produces the paradoxical outcome that sports
newspaper writers are much read but little.
